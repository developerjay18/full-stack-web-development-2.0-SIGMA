        Web development refers to the process of creating and maintaining
        websites and web applications. It involves a combination of programming
        languages, frameworks, and tools to build and deploy websites that meet
        specific requirements and objectives. Web development involves several
        stages, including front-end development, back-end development, and
        full-stack development. Front-end development involves building the
        client-side of the website, using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and
        JavaScript. Back-end development involves building the server-side of
        the website, including the database and server-side scripting languages
        such as PHP, Ruby, and Python. Full-stack development involves
        developing both the front-end and back-end of a website. Other important
        aspects of web development include web security, testing, and
        performance optimization. Web developers must also ensure their websites
        are optimized for search engine visibility and are accessible to all
        users, regardless of ability. Overall, web development is a crucial
        aspect of modern-day business, as it enables organizations to create a
        strong online presence and reach a wider audience.
