          HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the standard markup language used
          to create web pages. It is a language that defines the structure,
          content, and layout of a web page. HTML uses various tags and
          attributes to mark up text, images, videos, and other media types,
          making it possible for web browsers to display them in a visually
          appealing way. HTML also provides links and navigation elements that
          allow users to move from one page to another. HTML is not a
          programming language but rather a markup language that works in
          conjunction with other technologies such as CSS and JavaScript to
          create responsive, interactive, and dynamic web pages.

        <dd>
          Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a programming language used for
          styling web documents written in HTML or XML. It defines how HTML
          elements are to be displayed on screen, in print, or in other media.
          CSS allows web designers to control the layout, typography, colors,
          and other visual aspects of web pages. By separating the presentation
          from the content, CSS enables greater flexibility and consistency in
          web design. CSS rules consist of a selector and a declaration block,
          with properties and values that define how the selected elements
          should look. CSS is essential for modern web design and is widely used
          across the web development industry.

        <dt>JS</dt>
        <dd>
          JavaScript (JS) is a programming language used to add interactivity
          and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows web developers to create
          complex and interactive web applications, such as games, social media
          platforms, and e-commerce sites. JS can manipulate and change the
          content of web pages, respond to user events, and interact with
          server-side applications. JS code can be embedded directly into HTML
          documents or included as separate files, and it can be executed on
          both client-side and server-side environments. As one of the core
          technologies of the web, JS is essential for modern web development
          and is supported by all major web browsers.

        <dt>Git and GitHub</dt>
        <dd>
          Git is a distributed version control system used to manage source code
          and track changes made by developers. It enables developers to work
          collaboratively on a project, manage different versions of code, and
          revert to previous versions if necessary. GitHub is a web-based
          hosting service that provides a platform for developers to store,
          share, and collaborate on Git repositories. It offers features such as
          issue tracking, project management, and pull requests, which allow
          developers to review and merge code changes. GitHub has become a
          popular platform for open-source software development and is widely
          used by developers around the world.
