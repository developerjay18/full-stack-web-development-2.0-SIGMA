        <li>
          "h1 - h6"
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use "h1" for the main heading of a page, and use subsequent
              headings for subheadings in a hierarchical order.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use headings to create a clear and concise outline of the content
              of the page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use headings to emphasize important points or sections of the
              page.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't use heading tags purely for styling purposes. Use CSS to
              style headings instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use only one "h1" tag per page, as it should represent the main
              topic of the page.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          "p" (paragraph)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use "p" to enclose paragraphs of text on a web page. Each "p" tag
              should contain a single paragraph
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't use "p" tags for headings or subheadings. Use the
              appropriate heading tags for that purpose.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use semantic and descriptive text for the content of each
              paragraph, and avoid using filler or meaningless text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Break up long paragraphs into shorter ones for better readability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use proper indentation and spacing to make the content of each
              paragraph more readable.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          "sub" (subscript)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Don't use "sub" for text that is merely smaller in size. Use CSS
              to control the size of text instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use "sub" for superscript text that is positioned higher than the
              surrounding text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use semantic and descriptive text for the content of subscript
              text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use proper line-height and font-size to ensure the subscript text
              is legible and not too small.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid overusing subscript text, as it can make the content
              difficult to read and understand.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          "sup" (superscript)
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use "sup" to indicate superscript text. Superscript is typically
              used for footnotes, endnotes, mathematical exponents, <br />
              or text that is smaller and positioned higher than the surrounding
              text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't use "sup" for text that is merely smaller in size. Use CSS
              to control the size of text instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use proper line-height and font-size to ensure the superscript
              text is legible and not too small.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid overusing superscript text, as it can make the content
              difficult to read and understand.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use CSS to style superscript text instead of adding inline styles
              to individual "sup" tags.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          "strong"
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use "strong" to indicate text that is important, significant, or
              requires emphasis. This can include keywords, important phrases,
              or warnings.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't use "strong" for text that is merely bolded for stylistic
              purposes. Use CSS to control the styling of text instead.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use semantic and descriptive text for the content of "strong"
              tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid overusing "strong" tags, as it can make the content appear
              cluttered and distract from the most important points.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use CSS to style "strong" text instead of adding inline styles to
              individual "strong" tags.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <br />
        <li>
          "strike"
          <ul>
            <li>
              Use the "s" or "del" tag to indicate text that has been deleted or
              removed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use the "ins" tag to indicate text that has been added or
              inserted.
            </li>
            <li>
              Don't use the "strike" tag, as it is deprecated and may not be
              supported by all web browsers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use CSS to style deleted or inserted text instead of relying on
              the default styling of the tags.
            </li>
            <li>
              Avoid overusing these tags, as it can make the content appear
              cluttered and difficult to read.
