        In HTML, comments are lines of text that are not displayed in the web
        page itself but are intended to provide additional information about the
        code for developers or to temporarily remove code from the page without
        deleting it entirely. Comments in HTML are enclosed in special tags,
        which begin with "< ! - - and end with - ->". Anything within these tags
        will be ignored by the browser and will not be displayed on the webpage.
        Comments are an important tool for developers because they allow them to
        add explanatory notes or reminders within the code itself, making it
        easier to understand and modify. They can also be used to temporarily
        disable code without deleting it entirely, which can be useful during
        testing or debugging. Comments can be placed anywhere in the HTML code,
        including within the head and body sections of the document. It's
        important to note, however, that comments should not be used excessively
        or to explain obvious code, as this can make the code harder to read and
        understand. Additionally, comments can be viewed by anyone who has
        access to the source code, so sensitive information should not be
        included in them. In summary, comments in HTML are an important tool for
        developers that allow them to add explanatory notes, reminders, or
        temporarily disable code without deleting it entirely. They should be
        used judiciously and with caution to avoid making the code harder to
        read or exposing sensitive information.
