        In HTML, comments are used to add notes or annotations to the code that
        are not visible to the user when the page is rendered in a web browser.
        Comments are useful for leaving reminders, explanations, or other
        information that can help developers understand and maintain the code.
        Anything between the opening < !-- and closing -- > tags will be ignored
        by the web browser when rendering the page, and will not be visible to
        the user. For example, comments can be used to leave notes about the
        purpose of specific sections of the code, to temporarily disable
        sections of code during testing or development, or to communicate
        information to other developers working on the same project. It is
        important to note that comments should be used sparingly and only when
        necessary, as excessive comments can make code harder to read and
        understand. Comments should also be clear, concise, and relevant to the
        code, and should not contain unnecessary or redundant information.
        Overall, comments are a valuable tool in HTML for improving code
        readability and maintainability, and are an essential part of the coding
        process for web developers.
