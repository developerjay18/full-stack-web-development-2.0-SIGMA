            <h3>What is HTML ? </h3>
            <p>
                HTML, short for HyperText Markup Language, is the standard markup language used for creating web pages and applications. It provides a structured format for organizing and presenting content on the internet. HTML uses a system of tags to define the structure, layout, and appearance of elements within a web page. These tags specify headings, paragraphs, images, links, forms, and more. Alongside CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and JavaScript, HTML forms the foundation of the World Wide Web, enabling the creation of visually appealing and interactive websites. It allows information to be shared and accessed globally, connecting users and facilitating the exchange of data and media across digital platforms.

            <h3>What is semantic HTML</h3>
            <p>
                Semantic HTML refers to the practice of using HTML elements that accurately convey the meaning and structure of the content they enclose. It focuses on using elements with meaningful names and purpose, aiding both humans and search engines in understanding the document's organization. By utilizing semantic tags like `header`, `nav`, `article`, and `footer`, developers can create web pages that are accessible, maintainable, and optimized for search engine optimization (SEO). Semantic HTML improves the overall structure and clarity of the code, making it easier to read and navigate, enhancing the user experience, and providing a solid foundation for future design and development modifications.
