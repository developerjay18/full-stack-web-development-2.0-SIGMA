        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a fundamental technology used in web
        development to define the appearance and formatting of a webpage. It is
        a powerful tool that allows developers to control the visual
        presentation of HTML documents, enabling them to create engaging and
        aesthetically pleasing web designs. CSS works by associating styles with
        HTML elements, specifying how those elements should be displayed. By
        separating the content from its presentation, CSS provides greater
        flexibility, maintainability, and consistency across web pages. With
        CSS, you can control various aspects of a webpage, such as colors,
        fonts, layout, and animations, making it an essential part of modern web
        development.
