<!-- Que - 4
Let's now try to implement the CSS transform and transition property. In this coding challenge, you are expected to create a simple webpage with an image as shown in the reference image below. Note that website responsiveness is optional. On hovering the image must be zoomed slowly. -->

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
  <head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>Question 4</title>
    <!-- linking my CSS file -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="./question-4.css" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <div class="image-box">
      <img src="./assets/calm-nature.jpg" alt="nature-image" />
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
