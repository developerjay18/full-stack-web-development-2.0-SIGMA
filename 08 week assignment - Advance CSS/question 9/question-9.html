In this coding challenge, our goal is to implement CSS webkit and define CSS custom properties. The expected output, as shown in the provided image, demonstrates the usage of the same color in multiple places. To avoid repetition, we will define a custom color property at the top and utilize it throughout the webpage. Additionally, the content section will also incorporate a customized scrollbar by utilizing a CSS webkit to achieve the desired output. -->
